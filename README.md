Map of erasmus mundus programs
<p>The Erasmus Mundus Association is a professional network for Erasmus Mundus students and graduates. This webmap service works as a search tool for graduate programs by location and connects students to program websites.</p>
      <p>There are two modes: <b><i>Program</i></b> and <b><i>City</i></b>.  The first mode allows one to filter the programs in a map view by program name and displays markers for all locations of an individual program. The second mode displays programs and links them to individual webpages by city.<br>  The default filter for <b><i>Degree</i></b> and <b><i>Status</i></b> buttons were set with <b>All</b>, which displays both Master's and PhD programs.  To see only Master's or PhD programs, discontinued or ongoing, click on the corresponding buttons.  Discontinued programs were marked <b>D/C</b> and for the first time selected programs were marked with <b>NEW</b> label in the popup. For more details, please see the list of all <a href='http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/results_compendia/selected_projects_action_1_master_courses_en.php'>Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses</a>.</p>
